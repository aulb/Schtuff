Goal: 
- always want the max heap to have more element than the min heap
- adding number to max heap first, then immediately add to min heap
    - this way we are guaranteed to always have the greater half to be on the min heap
    - if we accidentally add too much to min heap, just simply pop the min heap and transfer over to the max heap

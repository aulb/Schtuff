making the decision to settle is terrifying because you dont know if youre gonna get complacent youre gonna get comfortable and that could easily be the rest of your life forever so its weird tho like you know that youre settling but even walking away from that is terrifying cause youre leaving the stability that youre not even really happy with to explore something else that will but you dont know just change in general is always scary i think the fear of being wrong is scary yea i think i really believe that life is what you make of it so even if you make a scary decision and you werent as right as you thought you were theres a lot of things to learn from that decision because i think that there were a lot of things that at my time here that really will equip me for later on in life in terms of like professional skills personal skills i dont think that i would have a life that i have today without you know being here in terms of you know my friends and my time here also professionally shows me what i want so all in all if you put all your eggs in a basket and its a terrifying decision to make and that doesnt pan out the way you think it will or that you hope it will like thats ok

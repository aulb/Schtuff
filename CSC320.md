###Question 42:
Combine images with feathering... Like normally?


###Question 43:
The issues with using feathering with a transition window of size w for blending is:

To select the size of the window used in feathering to avoid issues? Explain

When is it not possible to select good window size? 

###Question 44:
Code to produce k-th level Laplacian pyramid of Image I:
laplacian.py

###Question 45:


###Question 49 & 50:
q49.py

###Question ?:
Downside to blue-screen matting:
- Blue spilling, meaning some of the colors of the foreground objects are turning 'blue-ish' 
	Light reflected off background hits foreground turning it blueish

- No blue in foreground is very restrictive:
Example:
1) People with blue eyes will project the background through their eyes. Strict no blue colors allowed for foreground objects
2) No white, gray, pastel colors allowed
 
###Question ?:
Downside to known-background matting:
- No transitions, alpha is either 0 or 1.
- Background color must be known accurately and is constant (!)
- Foreground cannot have similar color to background
 
###Question 55:
q55.py

Write code to produce a mirror reflection of image I, followed by a rotation by 42 degrees around (1,1)
[ 0,  1,  0] [x]
[ 1,  0,  0] [y]
[ 0,  0,  1] [1]

###Question 56:
Do you want it like, after determining the coordinates of the pixels, do determine the pixel colors, we use bilinear interpolation instead. 

###Question 59:
